TOUHOU DOOM: UNTITLED EDITION -FINAL RELEASE-

This is a thing, because I like Doom and I like Touhou.

I used to have a section detailing the story of how Touhou Doom came about.
I'm not sure it's terribly respectful to someone who has become a better modder with time,
so I've decided to omit the history in this readme. You can find it in the Post-Mortem.

So instead I'll say this: Another modder made a Touhou-themed Doom wad.
I didn't like the original, but I decided that, as a fan of both,
if I wanted something better, then I would do it myself.

So here it is: The Final Release of Touhou Doom. Have fun!

Spriting is kind of crap because most of it's from the original Touhou Doom,
and the rest of it's from Touhou Fighting Games, which were originally 2D.

IN THIS PROJECT, YOU WILL FIND:
-Difficulty settings that actually affect the attacks bosses use!
-Touhou Music, which is why this thing is 340+ MB. Sorry about that!
-Comments that show my going nuts trying to code this!
-The Complete Touhou Doom:
	-EPISODE I (MAP01 to MAP09):
		-Faries: Stage Fairies for Stage 1 to Extra Stage (Based off of Touhou 6).

	-EPISODE II (MAP10 to MAP16):
